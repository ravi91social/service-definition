# OpenAPI generated server

Spring Boot Server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.
This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.


The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to Spring Boot is [springdoc](https://springdoc.org).
Springdoc will generate an OpenAPI v3 specification based on the generated Controller and Model classes.
The specification is available to download using the following url:
http://localhost:9090/v3/api-docs/

Start your server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui.html

Change default port value in application.properties

##  generate spring project from openapi.yaml file
-  make config.json file
```
   {
   "groupId":"",
   "artifactId":"",
   "artifactDescription":"",
   "basePackage":"",
   "apiPackage":"",
   "modelPackage":"",
   "configPackage":"",
   "requestMappingMode":"",
   "title":"",
   "delegatePattern":true
   }
```   

- run command 
```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -i C:\Users\User\Documents\service-request-assignment-contract.yaml -g spring
 -c  C:\Users\User\Documents\config.json
 ```
